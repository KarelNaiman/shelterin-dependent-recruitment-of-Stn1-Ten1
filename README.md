# shelterin-dependent-recruitment-of-Stn1-Ten1
scripts used in the paper: "The shelterin-dependent recruitment of Stn1-Ten1 ensures replication of hard to replicate subtelomeric regions in fission yeast"
These scripts allow to evaluate and visualise average origin activity over all rif1 binding sites (plotting_originactivity_around_rif_BSs) and over all G4s (plotting_originactivity_around_G4) in the whole genome of S.Pombe. The positions of Rif1-binding sites and G4s are defined in "strong_Rif1_BSs.bedgraph" and "sabouri_all_g4s.bedgraph" according to previously published papers (Kanoh et al, 2015 and Sabouri et al, 2014)
The plots gained from these scripts are in the figure S1B and S1C.
